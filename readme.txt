This website is a database to which any person can add.
People can go to the site to find products that are made in the United States.
When more people buy products made in the United States, it benefits the United States.
Furthermore it provides an incentive for companies to not outsource jobs for cheaper labor.

This is a joint project between Matthew Jurcak and Andrew Latham.
